My experiment is the Stroop Task designed for the geriatric population (i.e. larger font sizes and longer presentation of 
fixation points).Stimuli for this experiment will pertain three different colours, where there is a mismatch between the name
of a colour and the colour it is printed on (i.e. the word “red” is printed in blue ink) and a fixation point that will arise
between stimuli colour-word presentations. The colour-word will be presented on the screen and the participant will have unlimited amont of time to answer. To get the correct answer you must hit the designated keyboard key of the colour that the word is printed in, not what the word says (i.e. red =r, green=g, blue = b). There will be 3 blocks with 18 trails. 

Geriatric Stroop Task PseudoCode:

font arial 40

response_keys = ['r','g','b']
r is correct if = 'redred', 'greenred', 'bluered' 
g is correct if = 'greengreen', 'redgreen', 'bluegreen'
b is correct if = 'blueblue', 'greenblue', 'redblue'

#congruent stimuli = redred, blueblue, greengreen 
#incongruent stimuli = redgreen, redblue, greenred, greenblue, bluered, bluegreen 


stim_congruent = read_directory('redred/*png'or 'greengreen/*png' or 'blueblue/*png') #reading in all congruent images
stim_incongruent = read_directory('redgreen/*png' or 'redblue/*png' or 'greenred/*png' or 'greenblue/*png' or 'bluered/*png' or 'bluegreen/*png')
stim_fixation = read_directory('fixpoint/*png')
stim_correct = read_directory('correct/*png')
stim_mistake = read+directory('mistake/*png')

for block in range(3) #there are 3 blocks with 18 trials
	trials = [18]
print out('stim_fixation') at the beginning and after every feedback presentation
	shuffle('stim_congruent','stim_incongruent')
	display('stim_correct') if correct response
	else 
	display('stim_mistake')if incorrect response 
	2 minute break between 3 trials

subject = input()

display('stim_fixation') 
delay 6000 #6 second fixation point presentation 
print out shuffled list of stim_congruent and stim_incongruent #18 different stimuli combinations, 6 congruent and 12 incongruent 
delay until a key is pressed #stimuli presentation remains on the screen until a key is pressed 
  if correct key is hit then
    display('stim_correct') #feedback
  else
  if incorect key is hit then   
    display('stim_mistake') #feedback
  delay 6000 #6 second feedback presentation 
 end 

 for trials in trails
	resonse, rt = record_keyboard responses(response_keys) #collect responses during task
	display_fixpoint(6000-trail[]) #each trial 6s fixation point between 
	#after each trial save (response key, rt and trial number)

calculate number of correct responses 
calculate number of incorrect response 
calculate reaction time for correct conrguent reaction times
calculate reaction time for correct incongruent reaction times
